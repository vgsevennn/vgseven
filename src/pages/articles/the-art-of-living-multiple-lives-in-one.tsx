          <i>"The Art of Living Multiple Lives in one"</i>, the art itself
          highlights what they want to say and how important it is. There are
          too many successful people in the world right now who suggest that{" "}
          <i>“Reading is a thing which helps them to achieve success”</i>, but
          also there are tons of people who don't understand that yet. A famous
          quote about reading{" "}
          <i>
            “If you read books you live multiple lives, If you can't read books
            you live single life"
          </i>{" "}
          <i> (quotes credit goes to the writer who write that quote) </i> also
          helps us to understand the importance of reading but not completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading is an essential part of our life which always returns us some
          better results. Reading enhances imagination power, reading makes you
          more knowledgeable and also improves vocabulary and language
          proficiency. Reading makes us a better decision-maker as we understand
          things more deeply and can consider them from a different perspective.
          It also enhances the communication skills and makes socially a good
          person. With reading, we can acquire knowledge in different areas like
          culture, arts, history, regions and much more. Reading books and other
          stuff always increases creativity and enhances the understanding about
          life. Reading also inspires to write and one can fall in love with
          writing as well. The most important reason for reading is that we
          experience the situation of the author without living that situation
          in real life at all in case of non-fiction self-help books. But in
          other areas of books like fiction we receive tons of new information
          and also it helps to improve the power of imaginations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is too much about the book but the main title of the article is
          that art which helps to live a multiple life at once. Which is also a
          reading but not fiction, it’s non-fiction books about life. What
          fiction books do for us you know that already but what Non-Fiction
          books do is more than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every book the author includes their perspective towards that
          particular topic and shares their thinking process, experience,
          information, vision, view about that topic and many more things
          regarding that particular topic. And as we know our life has limited
          time to live and due to limited time we can’t test every situation in
          our life to collect our own information and perspective towards that
          particular topic and situations. Hence, we need to read books and
          articles about not only that problematic particular topic but every
          topic that is in your interest or you’ll read it. Because it always
          consists of a new perspective and experience of the author which we'll
          get if we read books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now You have the perspective, experience and information about that
          particular situation or topics or problem which you haven't
          experienced yet and you have more information than an average person
          which you can use as per your needs in your life to make better
          decisions and no need to test that situation again and again to waste
          our limited time. I know that everyone has different situations in
          their life, different problems but this information will always help
          you to make better decisions.
        </p>

          Here are my favorite books for you to read in 2023 to get started your
          reading journey.
