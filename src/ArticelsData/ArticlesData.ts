            'A single quote is enough to explain the importance of reading. In books every author always includes their perspective towards that particular topic and shares their thinking process, experience, information, vision, view about that topic and many more things regarding that particular topic. And as we know our life has limited time to live and due to limited time we can’t test every situation in our life to collect our own information and perspective towards that particular topic and situations.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Hence, we need to read books and articles about not only that problematic particular topic but every topic that is in your interest and you’ll read it. Because it always consists of a new perspective and experience of the author which we\'ll get if we read books. And hence "If you read books you live multiple lives\' \', because you have the perspective and experience, information about that particular situation which you can’t experience and live but you have that information because you read about it. And you can also apply this information as per your needs in your life to make better decisions and no need to test that situation again and again to waste our limited time.\n' +

            '\n' +
            'In the process of building new habits, the most important thing is to remind yourself about that particular habit and after completing that task next is to reward yourself for doing that which helps your brain to remember that thing to do again and again and you\'re on the way to build your next good habit.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'And in the process of breaking existing bad habits the steps are too similar to building habits. First of all you need to remember that particular bad habit and when you\'re doing that bad habit you have to remind your brain to stop that process and work on the spot. And to remember this process your brain needs a bad reward for doing that bad habit, so the brain remembers that reward with that particular bad habit and eventually you\'re on the way to breaking your bad habit.

            'Everything depends on what you\'re thinking and what you\'re thinking that will happen with you.  So if you think positive that will happen and if you think negative that will happen. According to human psychology and the workings of the human brain, our brain does exactly those things which we are repeating again and again to our mind and this is the only one reason that so many people say THINK POSITIVE. Because if we think positive our brain gets positive affirmations and the brain does these things for us or you can say the brain releases some instruction towards that particular task.'

            '\n' +
            'According to science, our body works under the control of our brain\'s instructions and the brain has the information which we always provide, which is used as information by the brain to process every request and provide the instructions to our body to perform any specific task. So think about it, *what we think depends on what we experience and what we feed into our brain system* and then if you think positively that will happen because your mind is always receiving information about that positive thinking and always thinking about it. And as a result our brain provides the same instructions to our body to work in that way.\n' +

As the brain has the power to control and shape life, we can say that our life totally depends on our thoughts and thought process. If you\'re able to control your thoughts by default you\'re controlling your life. It\'s work and experience by so many people including you and me also. So control your thoughts and by default you\'re able to control your life.\n' +

            'But the main problem is we\'re always unable to control our thoughts and thoughts system or brain thinking system. The mind is also known as "Monkey" just because the mind always thinks like a monkey which is jumping from one thought to another thoughts frequently. And what we need is to control that monkey\'s mind by thinking clearly.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Now let\'s explore how we can think clearly ? Clear Thinking is the process of thinking deeply as per all the real information to avoid bad decisions and that monkey mind. What we need to think about clearly is just collecting more information about that particular thing as much as the information your brain has to process that request. They work clearly and provide better decisions.\n' +

        Title: 'Do not Try to do Everything, try to do less but perfect..',
        Description: 'How many times in your day to day life have you tried Multi-Tasking and failed and feel stressed and confused ?\n' +
            'Forget it, tell me how many things you want to do in your life ?\n' +

            'Maybe there are too many things that you want to do and want to achieve in your life. But how many things did you actually do ?\n' +
            'Maybe a few of those things you did and doing some of those things And every time you tried to do more tasks at a time it always failed and you again feel stressed and confused.\n' +
            'That\'s the problem with our brain working system and we have to shape that working system to do less but perfect. As we grow and our knowledge grows (fast) our brain system always tries to do many more things in a single day and parallelly at a time. But it\'s not possible to do so many things at a time. You have to do all things one by one. Because every time you shift your brain from one task to another, the brain actually loses all its focus and attention period and flows towards that particular task and again when you\'re going to work on that particular task you have to waste your time to set attention and focus towards that particular thing. Hence I always suggest that to avoid Task Shifting, rather than task shifting, use Week or Day Scheduling methods to do all things which you want to do and achieve your best in those particular things.\n' +
            'Our main topic is "Do not try to do Everything." And here everything means not every task but some of them. For example, as we study so many things about any particular subject or topic, suddenly we want to learn everything about it. And this feeling of trying to do Everything will always damage you and your focused flow and you will also lose what you learn as you try to learn everything.\n' +
            '"Less but Perfect"\n' +
            'This one quote is enough to explain to you what I want to say. Less but Perfect, I see so many successful companies and people always follow these rules. They are doing less things in their life but they did those things so much perfectly and 10x better than others and hence they are successful and different from other ones.\n' +
            'While feeling stuck and so stressed and confused, even though we know so many things about our life, we are still feeling confused, stressed and depressed. The biggest reason is our dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction leads to poor productivity and thought process and Dissatisfaction occurs due to not any single reason but only from Trying to do Everything. If you\'re going to do everything you lose the things which you did and even those things which are in your control.\n' +
            'So Forget to do everything, first accomplish one thing and then focus on the next thing. It will help you to increase your productivity and go a long way from being confused. Trying to focus on two or more things at one time will not complete anything good at all. Just do things which are most important and try to say things which are not important to do.'
